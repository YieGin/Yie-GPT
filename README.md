## Guide to resolving OpenAI integration issue on website hosted on gh-pages

There seems to be an issue with the OpenAI integration on the website hosted on gh-pages. Unfortunately, I am unable to share my API_KEY with you to resolve this issue. However, you can easily fix it yourself by following these steps:

1### Visit https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys and create your own API keys.
2### Create a file named ".env" and put your API key in there.
3### Add the following code to the file:

API_KEY=Your Key
REACT_APP_OPENAI_KEY_IMAGE=2nd Key

It's important to note that you'll need to create two API keys, as we're using two different AI.

Once you've followed these steps, the backend of the website on gh-pages should work perfectly fine. If you have any further questions or issues, please don't hesitate to reach out.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start:backend`
### `npm run start:frontend` 

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
